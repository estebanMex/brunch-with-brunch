Application
===========

Put your application-specific files here, but leave your third party libraries in the vendor directory.  You do not need to separate types according to directory as Brunch will concatenate all js/css files automatically by default.  However, you can set the concatenation settings in `config.coffee` and using a directory structure can make more complex builds (multiple JS or CSS files) simpler.
